Running from QNS:

QNS_DIRECTORY, usually ~/qns, this is where you cloned the QNS repo.
MSP_DIRECTORY, usually ~/MySyntenyPortal, this is where you cloned MySyntenyPortal.

clone these projects.

cd QNS_DIRECTORY.

Run QNS with the arguments: 
"--export-config  -o <MSP_INPUT_DIRECTORY>"
(there's a good example in all_with_msp.sh).

You now have MSP inputs ready in QNS_DIRECTORY/MSP_INPUT_DIRECTORY.

cd MSP_DIRECTORY

Next, create the directory ./configurations if it doesn't already exist:
mkdir MSP_DIRECTORY/configurations

Copy QNS_DIRECTORY/MSP_INPUT_DIRECTORY/qns.conf to the directory MSP_DIRECTORY/configurations.

if it doesn't exist, create MSP_DIRECTORY/data
if it doesn't exist, create MSP_DIRECTORY/data/example_inputs.

copy QNS_DIRECTORY/MSP_INPUT_DIRECTORY/* to QNS_DIRECTORY/MSP_INPUT_DIRECTORY


We run MySyntenyPortal in docker. We mount $(PWD) (aka: this directory) as /code inside the docker.

We launch the whole portal with "kick-off-docker.sh". (this name is not ituitive, we should change it).

Kick off docker launches the portal using docker-compose up. And then, inside the container, it does this:

# docker-compose exec sweb perl ./mySyntenyPortal build -conf ./configurations/qns.conf

This looks in ./configurations to pick up qns.conf. qns.conf and all the .synteny files (referenced by
qns.conf) are generated by the qns.py program when the arguments "--export-config  -o <msp_input_directory>"
are used.
